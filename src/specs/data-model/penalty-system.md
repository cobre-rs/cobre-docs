# Penalty System

## Purpose

This spec defines the unified penalty system that ensures LP feasibility across all scenarios while correctly pricing operational costs and constraint violations. The penalty system uses a three-tier cascade resolution: global defaults → entity overrides → stage overrides.

This is a key area expected to evolve. See [LP Formulation](../math/lp-formulation.md) for how penalties enter the objective function.

## 1. Design Rationale

The LP must always be feasible. Several physical and operational constraints may be impossible to satisfy in extreme scenarios (droughts, equipment failures, etc.). The penalty system provides slack variables with graduated costs to maintain feasibility while signaling the severity of violations.

### Override Resolution Behavior

The penalty system supports three levels of specificity. The effective penalty for a given entity, stage, and penalty type is determined by the most specific value available:

1. **Stage-level override** — If a value is defined for this specific (entity, stage, penalty_type) tuple, it takes precedence.
2. **Entity-level override** — If no stage override exists, a per-entity default (defined in the entity registry file) is used.
3. **Global default** — If neither stage nor entity overrides exist, the global default from `penalties.json` applies.

| Query                       | Stage Override? | Entity Override? | Result                |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Hydro 0, Stage 30, spillage | No              | Yes (0.005)      | 0.005 (entity)        |
| Hydro 0, Stage 60, spillage | Yes (0.02)      | Yes (0.005)      | 0.02 (stage)          |
| Hydro 1, Stage 30, spillage | No              | No               | 0.01 (global default) |

> **Implementation note**: The resolution behavior above describes the _semantics_ of the cascade, not the algorithm. In practice, the implementation should pre-resolve penalties during input loading (e.g., start from global defaults, apply entity overrides while parsing registries, then batch-apply stage overrides) rather than querying files at runtime. The exact resolution strategy is an implementation concern.

### Format Rationale

| Tier             | File                                      | Format  | Rationale                                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Global defaults  | `penalties.json`                          | JSON    | Hierarchical config with nested cost categories; natural for defaults    |
| Entity overrides | `hydros.json`, `buses.json`, etc.         | JSON    | Per-entity overrides co-located with the entity definition               |
| Stage overrides  | `constraints/penalty_overrides_*.parquet` | Parquet | Sparse per-entity/per-stage tabular overrides in 4 entity-specific files |

## 2. Penalty Categories

Penalties serve three distinct purposes in the LP formulation. Understanding these categories is important for setting appropriate cost magnitudes and interpreting results.

### Category 1: Recourse Slacks (LP Feasibility)

These penalties ensure that the SDDP algorithm has relatively complete recourse — every subproblem must be feasible regardless of the scenario realization. Without these slacks, the LP would be infeasible when generation cannot meet demand or when excess uncontrollable generation cannot be absorbed.

| Penalty            | Units | Applied To                | Purpose                         | Typical Range      |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `deficit_segments` | $/MWh | Unmet load per bus        | Piecewise cost of load shedding | 1,000–10,000 $/MWh |
| `excess_cost`      | $/MWh | Excess generation per bus | Absorb uncontrollable surplus   | 0.001–0.1 $/MWh    |

Deficit and excess are conceptually slack variables on the load balance constraint, but they have special names because of their importance in the hydrothermal dispatch application. Deficit represents the value of lost load; excess is a regularization-level cost to eliminate spurious slack generation.

### Category 2: Constraint Violation Penalties (Policy Shaping)

These penalties provide slack for physical or operational constraints that may be impossible to satisfy under extreme conditions (e.g., drought, environmental directives from the system operator). Their cost must be high enough to affect the value function in earlier stages, signaling that the system should avoid states that lead to these violations.

| Penalty                           | Units      | Applied To                    | Purpose                                            | Typical Range      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `storage_violation_below_cost`    | $/hm3      | Storage < min (dead volume)   | Reservoir below dead volume — near-physical limit  | 10,000+ $/unit     |
| `filling_target_violation_cost`   | $/hm3      | Filling target not reached    | Terminal filling constraint — highest priority     | 50,000+ $/unit     |
| `turbined_violation_below_cost`   | $/(m3/s·h) | Turbined flow < min           | Equipment limits / ecological flow                 | 500–1,000 $/unit   |
| `outflow_violation_below_cost`    | $/(m3/s·h) | Outflow < min                 | Environmental minimum flow (operator/regulatory)   | 500–1,000 $/unit   |
| `outflow_violation_above_cost`    | $/(m3/s·h) | Outflow > max                 | Downstream flooding prevention                     | 500–1,000 $/unit   |
| `generation_violation_below_cost` | $/MWh      | Generation < min              | Contractual or environmental minimum generation    | 1,000–2,000 $/unit |
| `evaporation_violation_cost`      | $/(m3/s·h) | Evaporation constraint        | Physical constraint (bidirectional, see Section 6) | 5,000+ $/unit      |
| `water_withdrawal_violation_cost` | $/(m3/s·h) | Unmet water withdrawal        | Human consumption / irrigation commitments         | 1,000–5,000 $/unit |
| `generic_violation_cost`          | varies     | Generic constraint violations | User-defined physical or operational constraints   | User-defined       |

These penalties create an artificial cost in the objective function that propagates backward through the value function, telling earlier stages to store more water (or dispatch differently) to avoid reaching states where violations are necessary.

### Category 3: Regularization Costs (Solution Guidance)

These are small costs inserted into the objective function to guide the solver toward physically preferred solutions when the LP would otherwise be indifferent. They do not represent real costs and should be orders of magnitude smaller than any economic cost to avoid distorting the optimal policy.

| Penalty              | Units      | Applied To                     | Purpose                                                                          | Typical Range     |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `spillage_cost`      | $/(m3/s·h) | Water spilled                  | Prefer turbining over spilling when solver is indifferent                        | 0.001–0.01 $/unit |
| `fpha_turbined_cost` | $/(m3/s·h) | Turbined flow (FPHA only)      | Prevent interior FPHA solutions; must be > `spillage_cost` per plant (see below) | 0.01–0.1 $/unit   |
| `diversion_cost`     | $/(m3/s·h) | Water diverted                 | Prefer main channel flow; higher than spillage (water leaves cascade)            | 0.01–0.1 $/unit   |
| `curtailment_cost`   | $/MWh      | Curtailed non-controllable gen | Prioritize using available non-controllable generation over curtailing it        | 0.001–0.01 $/unit |
| `exchange_cost`      | $/MWh      | Power flow on lines            | Prefer local supply; avoid unnecessary inter-bus power flows                     | 0.01–1.0 $/unit   |

### Penalty Priority Ordering

When setting penalty magnitudes, the following ordering must be maintained:

$$\text{Filling target} > \text{Storage violation} > \text{Deficit} > \text{Constraint violations} > \text{Resource costs} > \text{Regularization}$$

The filling target violation cost must be the highest penalty in the system — filling the dead volume is prioritized above all other objectives. The storage violation below cost must exceed deficit cost — keeping reservoirs above dead volume is more critical than serving load (operating below dead volume risks dam safety and equipment damage).

**FPHA validation rule**: For each hydro using the `fpha` production model, `fpha_turbined_cost > spillage_cost` must hold. The concave FPHA geometry allows interior LP solutions where generation is less than the physical production function would yield — the turbined flow penalty prevents the solver from "spilling through the turbines." See [Internal Structures §3](internal-structures.md) for the full explanation.

## 3. Global Penalty Defaults (`penalties.json`)

This file defines default penalty values for all entities. It is **required** and must be present in the case directory root.

```json

  "$schema": "https://cobre.dev/schemas/v2/penalties.schema.json",

    "water_withdrawal_violation_cost": 1000.0
  },
  "non_controllable_source": {
    "curtailment_cost": 0.005
  }
}
```

### Piecewise Deficit

Deficit is modeled as piecewise linear segments. Each segment specifies a depth (MW of unmet demand) and cost. Segments are cumulative: first `depth_mw` MW at first cost, next at second cost, etc. The last segment **MUST** have `depth_mw: null` to ensure LP feasibility (unbounded extension).

Deficit segments can be overridden per bus in `buses.json` (see [Input System Entities §1](input-system-entities.md)), but **cannot be stage-varying** (piecewise structure is too complex for per-stage override).

## 4. Constraint Violation Categories

This section enumerates all constraints in the LP that use slack variables, organized by the system element they belong to. For the full LP constraint formulations, see [LP Formulation](../math/lp-formulation.md).

### System-Level (Bus)

| Constraint Type | Slack Variable | Direction                  | Penalty            | Category |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Load balance    | `deficit`      | Lower (unmet demand)       | `deficit_segments` | Recourse |
| Load balance    | `excess`       | Upper (surplus generation) | `excess_cost`      | Recourse |

### Hydro — Flow and Generation Constraints

| Constraint Type    | Slack Variable               | Direction   | Penalty                           | Category             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Minimum storage    | `storage_violation_below`    | Lower bound | `storage_violation_below_cost`    | Constraint violation |
| Filling target     | `filling_target_violation`   | Lower bound | `filling_target_violation_cost`   | Constraint violation |
| Minimum turbined   | `turbined_violation_below`   | Lower bound | `turbined_violation_below_cost`   | Constraint violation |
| Minimum outflow    | `outflow_violation_below`    | Lower bound | `outflow_violation_below_cost`    | Constraint violation |
| Maximum outflow    | `outflow_violation_above`    | Upper bound | `outflow_violation_above_cost`    | Constraint violation |
| Minimum generation | `generation_violation_below` | Lower bound | `generation_violation_below_cost` | Constraint violation |
| Evaporation        | `evaporation_violation_pos`  | Upper slack | `evaporation_violation_cost`      | Constraint violation |
| Evaporation        | `evaporation_violation_neg`  | Lower slack | `evaporation_violation_cost`      | Constraint violation |
| Water withdrawal   | `water_withdrawal_violation` | Lower bound | `water_withdrawal_violation_cost` | Constraint violation |

### Hydro — Storage Bounds

**Minimum storage** (`min_storage_hm3`) uses a slack variable (`storage_violation_below`) with a very high penalty cost — above deficit cost in the penalty hierarchy. Operating below dead volume risks dam safety and equipment damage, so this is treated as a near-physical violation. The slack ensures LP feasibility in extreme scenarios (severe drought, or the transition from filling to operating when the reservoir did not fully reach `min_storage_hm3`).

**Maximum storage** (`max_storage_hm3`) is a hard physical limit (reservoir capacity). If storage would exceed the maximum, emergency spillage handles the excess. No slack variable is used.

**Filling target constraint**: At the last filling stage (`entry_stage_id - 1`), a terminal constraint enforces `v_h >= min_storage_hm3`. This uses the `filling_target_violation` slack with the highest penalty in the system (`filling_target_violation_cost`), ensuring the solver prioritizes filling above all other objectives including load serving. The slack only activates when there is physically insufficient water — see [Input System Entities §3](input-system-entities.md) for the filling model description and [Input Constraints §2](input-constraints.md) for the filling inflow sufficiency validation.

### Lines

**Exchange bounds** are hard variable bounds on the direct and reverse flow variables. No slack variables. The `exchange_cost` is a regularization term on the flow variables themselves, not a violation penalty.

### Thermals

**Thermal bounds** (`min_generation`, `max_generation`) are hard constraints. No slack variables. Thermal dispatch is directly controllable (unlike hydro, which depends on exogenous inflows), so if bounds cannot be met, this indicates a data error.

### Generic Constraints

User-defined generic constraints (see [Input Constraints](input-constraints.md)) can optionally have slack variables with user-specified penalty costs. These are typically used for physical or operational directives from the system operator, and fall into the **constraint violation** category.

### Non-Controllable Sources

**Non-controllable generation bounds**: Generation is bounded by `[0, available_generation]` where `available_generation` comes from the scenario pipeline. Both bounds are hard constraints — no slack variables. The `curtailment_cost` is a regularization term (Category 3) applied to the difference between available and dispatched generation, penalizing curtailment to prioritize using "free" non-controllable energy. Analogous to hydro `spillage_cost` — curtailment discards available energy. See [Input System Entities §7](input-system-entities.md).

## 5. Stage-Varying Penalty Overrides

Stage-varying overrides allow penalty values to change at specific stages for specific entities. Only entries that differ from the entity or global defaults need to be specified (sparse storage). Each entity type has its own Parquet file under `constraints/`.

### Bus Penalty Overrides (`constraints/penalty_overrides_bus.parquet`) — Optional

| `stage_id`                        | u32  | No       | Stage identifier                       |

| `storage_violation_below_cost`    | f64  | Yes      | $/hm3 for storage below min            |

| `outflow_violation_below_cost`    | f64  | Yes      | $/(m3/s·h) for outflow below min       |
| `outflow_violation_above_cost`    | f64  | Yes      | $/(m3/s·h) for outflow above max       |

| `water_withdrawal_violation_cost` | f64  | Yes      | $/(m3/s·h) for unmet water withdrawal  |

### Non-Controllable Source Penalty Overrides (`constraints/penalty_overrides_ncs.parquet`) — Optional

| Column             | Type | Nullable | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | ---- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source_id`        | u32  | No       | Non-controllable source identifier                        |
| `stage_id`         | u32  | No       | Stage identifier                                          |
| `curtailment_cost` | f64  | Yes      | $/MWh for curtailed available generation (null = default) |

**Sparse storage**: Only include entries where values differ from defaults to minimize file size and I/O.

## 6. Negative Evaporation (Condensation) Handling

While evaporation is typically positive (water loss), the evaporation coefficient can be negative:

| Condition               | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Condensation            | Water condensing on reservoir surface in humid climates                                         |
| Rainfall contribution   | When models include net precipitation effects                                                   |
| Linearization artifacts | The linear approximation may produce negative values at certain volume/coefficient combinations |

The evaporation constraint uses **bidirectional slack variables**:

```
Q_evaporated - evap_slack_positive + evap_slack_negative = EvapCoef x Area(V_avg)

where:
  evap_slack_positive >= 0  (actual evap > computed evap)
  evap_slack_negative >= 0  (actual evap < computed evap, including negative target)
```

Both slack variables receive the same penalty: `evaporation_violation_cost`.

## 7. Hydro Variables and Bounds Summary

| Variable        | Lower Bound            | Upper Bound         | Lower Slack  | Upper Slack     |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| `storage`       | `min_storage_hm3`      | `max_storage_hm3`   | With penalty | Emergency spill |
| `turbined_flow` | `min_turbined_m3s`     | `max_turbined_m3s`  | With penalty | Hard            |
| `spillage`      | 0                      | Inf                 | Hard         | —               |
| `outflow`       | `min_outflow_m3s`      | `max_outflow_m3s`   | With penalty | With penalty    |
| `generation`    | `min_generation_mw`    | `max_generation_mw` | With penalty | Hard            |
| `evaporation`   | -Inf (can be negative) | +Inf                | With penalty | With penalty    |
| `withdrawal`    | `water_withdrawal`     | `water_withdrawal`  | With penalty | —               |

> **Generation bounds**: The user explicitly sets `min_generation_mw` and `max_generation_mw`. These are not derived from turbined flow bounds, because the production function is not always constant productivity. When a complete hydro model is available, the installed capacity provides a natural hard upper bound. The lower bound always requires a slack to maintain feasibility.

Relationship: `outflow = turbined_flow + spillage`, `generation = f(turbined_flow, storage)` (depends on production model)

### Dead-Volume Filling Specifics

During the filling period (`[start_stage_id, entry_stage_id)`), the hydro is in commissioning state. The reservoir is being filled to `min_storage_hm3` (dead volume). This model is based on CEPEL's dead-volume filling approach (`enchimento de volume morto`).

**Operational constraints during filling**:

- **No generation**: `turbined_flow = 0`, `generation = 0` (hard constraint — turbines not installed/operational)
- **Outflow via spillage only**: During filling, turbines are not operational. Outflow is limited to spillage once water reaches the spillway crest. Bottom discharge outlets are a simulation-only feature (see [Input System Entities §3](input-system-entities.md)).
- **Min outflow requirement**: Environmental flow must be met via spillage. If spillage is not physically possible (reservoir level below spillway crest), the `outflow_violation_below` slack absorbs the shortfall.
- **Filling retention**: `filling_inflow_m3s` (from [Input Constraints §2](input-constraints.md)) is removed from available inflow before the water balance — it goes directly to storage.
- **Storage bounds relaxed**: `min_storage_hm3` does not apply during filling — storage can be anywhere in `[0, max_storage_hm3]`.

**Terminal filling constraint**: At the last filling stage (`entry_stage_id - 1`), a constraint enforces:

```
v_h >= min_storage_hm3 - filling_target_violation
```

where `filling_target_violation >= 0` has `filling_target_violation_cost` — the highest penalty in the system. This ensures the solver prioritizes filling above all other objectives. The slack only activates when nature physically did not provide enough water.

**Transition to operating**: At `entry_stage_id`, the hydro becomes operational. The storage at the end of the last filling stage becomes the initial storage for the first operating stage. If `filling_target_violation > 0` (filling fell short), the operating stage's own `storage_violation_below` slack handles the shortfall — both LPs remain feasible.

**Penalties during filling**: The same `outflow_violation_cost` from `penalties.json` applies. Spillage during filling also incurs `spillage_cost`. The `storage_violation_below` slack is not active during filling (storage is allowed below `min_storage_hm3` by design).

## 8. LP Objective Function Impact

For each stage `t`, block `b`, scenario `s`:

```
minimize:
  // Resource costs
  + Sigma_thermal (generation x cost_per_mwh)
  + Sigma_contract (import x import_price - export x export_price)

  // Recourse slacks (LP feasibility)
  + Sigma_bus Sigma_segment (deficit_segment x segment_cost)
  + Sigma_bus (excess x excess_cost)

> **Note on pumping**: Pumping stations do not have an explicit cost in the objective. The cost of pumping is implicitly captured through the energy consumed at the connected bus (appears as negative demand in the load balance). The marginal cost at that bus determines the effective pumping cost.
