# Shared Memory and Aggregation

## Purpose

This spec defines the intra-node shared memory usage patterns, reproducibility guarantees, and performance monitoring for Cobre. It extends [Communication Patterns §5](./communication-patterns.md) with detailed `SharedRegion<T>` allocation and access patterns, consolidates reproducibility requirements from across the approved specs, and defines performance monitoring interpretation. For the collective operations and their semantics, see [Communication Patterns](./communication-patterns.md) and [Synchronization](./synchronization.md).

## 1. Intra-Node Shared Memory

### 1.1 SharedRegion\<T\> Usage Model

The `SharedMemoryProvider` trait ([Communicator Trait SS4](./communicator-trait.md)) allows ranks on the same physical node to share memory regions via `SharedRegion<T>` ([Communicator Trait SS4.2](./communicator-trait.md)) handles. Cobre uses a **leader allocation pattern**: one rank per node (the leader, determined by `is_leader()` from the `SharedMemoryProvider` trait, which returns `true` for rank 0 within the intra-node communicator from `split_local()` ([Communicator Trait SS4.1](./communicator-trait.md))) allocates the shared region; other ranks on the same node access it via the region handle.

| Role     | Allocation                                                   | Read Access                     | Write Access                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Leader   | Calls `create_shared_region(count)` -- allocates full region | `region.as_slice()` (zero-copy) | `region.as_mut_slice()`, then `region.fence()` |
| Follower | Receives handle to leader's region (size 0 local allocation) | `region.as_slice()` (zero-copy) | Not permitted (leader writes on behalf)        |

The `SharedRegion<T>` type provides RAII semantics — `Drop` automatically frees the underlying shared memory resource (MPI window for ferrompi, OS shared segment for shm, `Vec<T>` for HeapFallback). See [Communicator Trait SS4.2](./communicator-trait.md).

### 1.2 Shared Data: Opening Tree

The opening tree (fixed noise vectors for the backward pass — see [Scenario Generation §2.3](../architecture/scenario-generation.md)) is the primary candidate for `SharedRegion<T>`:

| Property        | Value                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Size            | $N_{\text{openings}} \times T \times N_{\text{entities}} \times 8$ bytes (~30 MB at production scale) |
| Access pattern  | Read-only during training (generated once before first iteration)                                     |
| Sharing benefit | Avoid replicating ~30 MB per rank on same node (4 ranks = 90 MB saved)                                |
| Write phase     | Leader generates during initialization, `region.fence()` ensures visibility                           |
| Memory layout   | Opening-major ordering for backward pass locality (see scenario-generation.md §2.3)                   |

**Generation protocol:**

1. Create intra-node communicator via `comm.split_local()` ([Communicator Trait SS4.1](./communicator-trait.md))
2. Leader calls `create_shared_region::<f64>(count)` ([Communicator Trait SS4.1](./communicator-trait.md)) with total opening tree size; followers allocate size 0
3. Distribute generation work across ranks within the node (each rank generates its assigned portion via contiguous block assignment)
4. Each rank writes its portion directly to the shared region at the correct offset
5. `region.fence()` ensures all writes are visible to all ranks on the node
6. All ranks read any opening via `region.as_slice()` (zero-copy)

### 1.3 Shared Data: Input Case Data

Static input data (hydro parameters, thermal parameters, system topology) loaded during initialization is read-only during training. Sharing via `SharedRegion<T>` avoids per-rank replication:

| Data                   | Approximate Size | Shareable? | Notes                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| System entity data     | ~10 MB           | Yes        | Read-only after initialization    |
| PAR model parameters   | ~5 MB            | Yes        | Preprocessed contiguous arrays    |
| Correlation factors    | ~2 MB            | Yes        | Cholesky factors, one per profile |
| Block/exchange factors | ~1 MB            | Yes        | Loaded once, read-only            |

Whether these smaller data structures justify `SharedRegion<T>` overhead (allocation, fence, pointer indirection) depends on the number of ranks per node. With 4+ ranks per node, the savings compound.

### 1.4 Shared Data: Cut Pool (Optimization Candidate)

The cut pool grows each iteration and is the largest runtime data structure. Sharing the cut pool via `SharedRegion<T>` would eliminate per-rank replication within a node:

| Property            | Baseline (replicated)                   | Shared (optimization)                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Memory per node     | Cut pool size × ranks per node          | Cut pool size × 1                        |
| Read access         | Local memory (fastest)                  | Shared window pointer (may cross NUMA)   |
| Write access        | Each rank updates locally               | Leader writes, fence, followers read     |
| Forward pass read   | Hot-path: evaluating cuts at each stage | Potentially slower if shared across NUMA |
| Backward pass write | Each rank adds new cuts                 | Leader integrates after `allgatherv`     |

> **Design point**: The baseline approach (each rank maintains its own cut pool, synchronized via `allgatherv`) is simple and correct. Shared memory cut pool is an optimization for memory-constrained nodes, with a latency trade-off. The quantification of this trade-off depends on the production-scale cut pool size — see [Memory Architecture](./memory-architecture.md). See also [Communication Patterns §5.2](./communication-patterns.md).

## 2. Intra-Node Cut Aggregation

### 2.1 Baseline: Flat allgatherv

The approved architecture uses flat `allgatherv` for cut distribution: every rank sends its cuts and every rank receives all cuts. There is no hierarchical aggregation, no root-based reduction, and no point-to-point messaging. See [Synchronization §1.1](./synchronization.md) and [Communication Patterns §1.2](./communication-patterns.md).

### 2.2 Optimization: Two-Level Aggregation

For deployments with many ranks per node (8+), a two-level aggregation can reduce inter-node `allgatherv` volume by first aggregating cuts within a node:

1. **Level 1 (Intra-node)**: Ranks on the same node contribute cuts to shared memory via `SharedRegion<T>` (via the `SharedMemoryProvider` trait). The node leader collects and deduplicates if applicable.
2. **Level 2 (Inter-node)**: Node leaders participate in `allgatherv` across nodes, exchanging the aggregated per-node cut sets.
3. **Distribute within node**: Node leaders write received remote cuts to shared memory; `region.fence()` ensures visibility.

This reduces the `allgatherv` participant count from $R$ total ranks to $R / R_{\text{node}}$ node leaders, reducing collective latency for large rank counts. However, it adds intra-node synchronization overhead.

> **Design decision**: Two-level aggregation is an optimization for large-scale deployments (64+ ranks). For the initial implementation with moderate rank counts (4-16 ranks), flat `allgatherv` is sufficient. Profiling should guide whether to enable this optimization. See [Communication Patterns §3.2](./communication-patterns.md) for bandwidth analysis showing communication fraction < 2% even on Ethernet.

## 3. Reproducibility Guarantees

### 3.1 Requirement

Given the same inputs and random seed, Cobre must produce **bit-for-bit identical** results regardless of:

| Must Be Independent Of            | Mechanism                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of MPI ranks               | Deterministic seeding, contiguous block distribution, deterministic cut slots |
| Number of OpenMP threads per rank | Thread-local accumulation, OpenMP barrier, single-threaded merge              |
| Execution timing/ordering         | Identity-based seeding, deterministic `allgatherv` rank ordering              |

### 3.2 Component-Level Reproducibility

Each component of the SDDP pipeline has specific reproducibility mechanisms:

| Component                | Mechanism                                                                   | Reference                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scenario noise           | Deterministic seed from `(base_seed, iteration, scenario, stage)`           | [Scenario Generation §2.2](../architecture/scenario-generation.md)           |
| Opening tree             | Deterministic seed from `(base_seed, opening_index, stage)`                 | [Scenario Generation §2.3](../architecture/scenario-generation.md)           |
| Forward pass assignment  | Contiguous block distribution by rank index                                 | [Work Distribution §3.1](./work-distribution.md)                             |
| Backward pass assignment | Contiguous block distribution by rank index                                 | [Work Distribution §2.1](./work-distribution.md)                             |
| Cut slot positions       | Deterministic from `(iteration, forward_pass_index)`                        | [Cut Management Implementation §4.3](../architecture/cut-management-impl.md) |
| Cut synchronization      | `allgatherv` receives in rank order (0, 1, ..., R-1)                        | [Communication Patterns §6.1](./communication-patterns.md)                   |
| Cut selection            | Deterministic algorithm on identical data (all ranks compute independently) | [Cut Management Implementation §6](../architecture/cut-management-impl.md)   |
| LP constraint order      | Cuts added by slot index (iteration order)                                  | [Solver Abstraction §5](../architecture/solver-abstraction.md)               |

### 3.3 Floating-Point Considerations

**Reductions**: `allreduce` with `ReduceOp::Sum` may produce different results depending on the reduction tree shape (non-associativity of floating-point addition). For convergence statistics this is acceptable — the upper bound is a statistical estimate. See [Communication Patterns §6.2](./communication-patterns.md).

**OpenMP reductions**: Thread-local accumulation followed by single-threaded merge (see [Synchronization §3](./synchronization.md)) produces deterministic results because the merge order is fixed (thread 0, thread 1, ..., thread $N-1$). This avoids the non-determinism of `#pragma omp reduction(+:sum)` where summation order depends on thread scheduling.

**Cut coefficient aggregation**: For single-cut formulation, per-opening results are aggregated within each thread (sequential — deterministic), then merged across threads (fixed order — deterministic), then exchanged via `allgatherv` (rank order — deterministic). The final averaging is performed locally by each rank on the full set of results (identical data — deterministic). No floating-point non-determinism is introduced at any step.

### 3.4 Verification

Reproducibility can be verified by running the same case with different rank/thread configurations and comparing:

| Quantity          | Comparison                 | Expected Result        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Lower bound trace | Bit-for-bit across configs | Identical              |
| Upper bound mean  | Within FP tolerance        | ~1e-12 relative error  |
| Final cut pool    | Bit-for-bit across configs | Identical coefficients |
| Policy output     | Bit-for-bit across configs | Identical              |

Upper bound mean may have small FP differences due to `allreduce` tree shape variation, but the lower bound and cut pool (which determine the policy) must be exact.

## 4. Performance Monitoring

### 4.1 Approved Timing Outputs

Cobre writes per-iteration and per-rank timing data to Parquet files during training. The schemas are defined in [Output Schemas §6.2-§6.3](../data-model/output-schemas.md):

**Per-iteration** (`training/timing/iterations.parquet`): forward solve, backward solve, cut computation, cut selection, MPI communication, I/O, overhead.

**Per-rank** (`training/timing/mpi_ranks.parquet`): forward time, backward time, communication time, idle time, LP solve count, scenarios processed.

### 4.2 Diagnostic Interpretation

| Symptom                                      | Metric to Check                         | Likely Cause                                    | Mitigation                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Idle time >> 0 on some ranks                 | `idle_time_ms` variance across ranks    | Load imbalance                                  | Check LP iteration count variance; consider NUMA placement       |
| Communication time growing across iterations | `communication_time_ms` trend           | Cut count growth increases `allgatherv` payload | Enable cut selection to bound active cut count                   |
| Forward time >> backward time                | `forward_time_ms` vs `backward_time_ms` | Many forward passes, few trial points per rank  | Expected for high $M / R$ ratio                                  |
| Backward time growing across iterations      | `backward_solve_ms` trend               | More cuts in FCF → larger LPs → longer solves   | Enable cut selection; check for dominated cuts                   |
| Communication fraction > 10%                 | `communication_time_ms / total`         | Insufficient compute per rank                   | Reduce rank count (fewer, larger ranks); check network bandwidth |

### 4.3 Load Balance Assessment

The primary load balance indicator is the ratio of maximum to minimum `forward_time_ms` (or `backward_time_ms`) across ranks within an iteration. With static contiguous block distribution and homogeneous LP structure, this ratio should be close to 1.0:

| Imbalance Ratio | Assessment  | Action                                          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| < 1.1           | Excellent   | None needed                                     |
| 1.1 - 1.2       | Acceptable  | Monitor — may improve with NUMA tuning          |
| 1.2 - 1.5       | Notable     | Check NUMA placement, check LP iteration counts |
| > 1.5           | Significant | Investigate — likely NUMA or hardware issue     |
