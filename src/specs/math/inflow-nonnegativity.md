# Inflow Non-Negativity Solution Methods

## Purpose

This spec defines the four methods available for handling negative inflow realizations produced by the PAR(p) model, including their LP formulations, objective function modifications, and trade-offs.

## 1. Problem Statement

The PAR(p) model can generate negative inflow realizations:

$$
a_h = \underbrace{\mu_m - \sum_{\ell=1}^{p} \psi_\ell \mu_{m-\ell}}_{\text{deterministic base}} + \underbrace{\sum_{\ell=1}^{p} \psi_\ell \cdot \hat{a}_{h,\ell}}_{\text{lag contribution}} + \underbrace{\sigma_m \cdot \eta}_{\text{noise term}}
$$

When $\eta$ is sufficiently negative (e.g., $\eta < -2$), the total can become negative, which is physically impossible.

## 2. Penalty Classification

The inflow non-negativity penalty $c^{inf}$ is a **Category 2 constraint violation penalty** — it provides slack for a physical constraint (non-negative inflow) that may be impossible to satisfy under extreme noise realizations. Its position in the penalty hierarchy (see [LP Formulation §1.5](lp-formulation.md)):

$$c^{tv-}, c^{ov\pm}, c^{gv-}, c^{ev}, c^{wv}, c^{inf} > c^{th}, c^{ctr}$$

Since inflow $a_h$ is defined per stage (not per block), the inflow non-negativity penalty appears **outside** the block summation in the objective, alongside storage violation penalties:

$$
+ \sum_{h \in \mathcal{H}} c^{inf} \cdot \sigma^{inf}_h \cdot T
$$

where $T = \sum_k \tau_k$ is the total stage duration in hours. The product $\sigma^{inf}_h \cdot T$ converts the slack rate (m³/s) to an energy-equivalent dimension over the full stage.

## 3. Method: `none`

**Configuration**:

```json
{ "modeling": { "inflow_non_negativity": { "method": "none" } } }
```

**LP Formulation**: Standard AR constraint (unchanged):

$$
a_h = \text{deterministic\_base} + \sum_{\ell=1}^{p} \psi_\ell \cdot a_{h,\ell} + \sigma_m \cdot \eta
$$

**Implications**:

- LP may become **infeasible** when $a_h < 0$ causes water balance violation
- Useful only for debugging or when the AR model guarantees positive outputs
- **Not recommended for production**

## 4. Method: `penalty`

**Configuration**:

```json
{
  "modeling": {
    "inflow_non_negativity": {
      "method": "penalty",
      "penalty_cost": 1000.0
    }
  }
}
```

**Additional Variables**:

| Variable         | Domain   | Units | Description                 |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| $\sigma^{inf}_h$ | $\geq 0$ | m³/s  | Inflow non-negativity slack |

**Modified AR Constraint**:

$$
a_h + \sigma^{inf}_h = \text{deterministic\_base} + \sum_{\ell=1}^{p} \psi_\ell \cdot a_{h,\ell} + \sigma_m \cdot \eta
$$

**Interpretation**: When the AR model produces negative $a_h$, the slack $\sigma^{inf}_h$ absorbs the violation, making the effective inflow:

$$
a_h^{effective} = a_h + \sigma^{inf}_h \geq 0
$$

**Objective Function Addition** (outside block summation):

$$
+ \sum_{h \in \mathcal{H}} c^{inf} \cdot \sigma^{inf}_h \cdot T
$$

where $c^{inf}$ is the penalty cost (default: 1000 \$/(m³/s·h)) and $T = \sum_k \tau_k$ is the total stage duration in hours.

**Advantages**:

- LP always feasible
- Clear cost signal for negative inflow events
- Preserves AR dynamics for positive realizations

**Disadvantages**:

- Adds variables and constraints
- Slightly affects marginal water values

**Recommended for most production cases.**

## 5. Method: `truncation`

**Configuration**:

```json
{ "modeling": { "inflow_non_negativity": { "method": "truncation" } } }
```

**Scenario Generation**:

$$
a_h = \max\left(0, \text{deterministic\_base} + \sum_{\ell=1}^{p} \psi_\ell \cdot \hat{a}_{h,\ell} + \sigma_m \cdot \eta\right)
$$

**LP Formulation**: Standard AR constraint with the already-truncated $a_h$ value:

$$
a_h = \text{(truncated value from scenario)}
$$

**Advantages**:

- No additional LP variables or constraints
- Straightforward formulation

**Disadvantages**:

- **Biases the distribution**: Shifts mean upward
- **Breaks AR dynamics**: When truncation occurs, temporal correlation is disrupted
- May affect long-term storage dynamics

## 6. Method: `truncation_with_penalty`

**Configuration**:

```json
{
  "modeling": {
    "inflow_non_negativity": {
      "method": "truncation_with_penalty",
      "penalty_cost": 1000.0
    }
  }
}
```

**Description**: Hybrid approach that truncates the final inflow but penalizes the statistical violation in the noise term. Based on the YP_FINF slack in SPARHTACUS/SPTcpp.

**Additional Variables**:

| Variable | Domain   | Units | Description                            |
| -------- | -------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| $\xi_h$  | $\geq 0$ | -     | Noise adjustment slack (dimensionless) |

**Modified AR Constraint** (in two parts):

**Part A — Modified noise term**:

$$
\eta_h^{adj} = \eta_h + \xi_h
$$

where $\eta_h$ is the original (possibly very negative) noise realization.

**Part B — Inflow with adjusted noise**:

$$
a_h = \text{deterministic\_base} + \sum_{\ell=1}^{p} \psi_\ell \cdot a_{h,\ell} + \sigma_m \cdot \eta_h^{adj}
$$

**Non-negativity constraint**:

$$
a_h \geq 0
$$

**Interpretation**: The optimizer chooses $\xi_h$ to be the minimum adjustment needed to make $a_h \geq 0$:

$$
\xi_h = \max\left(0, -\eta_h - \frac{\text{deterministic\_base} + \sum_\ell \psi_\ell \cdot \hat{a}_{h,\ell}}{\sigma_m}\right)
$$

**Objective Function Addition** (outside block summation):

$$
+ \sum_{h \in \mathcal{H}} c^{inf} \cdot \sigma_m \cdot \xi_h \cdot T
$$

The penalty is proportional to $\sigma_m \cdot \xi_h$, which is the actual inflow adjustment in m³/s. Note that $\sigma_m$ varies by season, so the effective penalty for a given noise adjustment $\xi_h$ is larger in high-variability seasons and smaller in low-variability seasons. This is by design — a given noise adjustment represents a larger physical inflow correction when $\sigma_m$ is large.

**Advantages**:

- Preserves AR model structure better than pure truncation
- Penalty signals statistical violation severity
- Effective inflow is always non-negative

**Disadvantages**:

- More complex formulation
- Requires careful interaction with noise generation
