# Input Loading Pipeline

## Purpose

This spec defines the Cobre input loading architecture: the rank-0 centric loading pattern, file loading sequence with dependency ordering, dependency resolution, conditional loading rules, sparse time-series expansion, data broadcasting strategy, parallel policy loading for warm-start, and the transition to the in-memory data model.

For the file inventory and directory layout, see [Input Directory Structure](../data-model/input-directory-structure.md).
For the in-memory data model after loading completes, see [Internal Structures](../data-model/internal-structures.md).

## 1. Loading Architecture

Input loading follows a **rank-0 centric** pattern: rank 0 loads and validates all input data, then broadcasts to worker ranks. This design:

- Minimizes filesystem contention on parallel filesystems
- Centralizes validation logic on a single rank
- Reduces complexity of error handling across ranks
- Ensures all ranks receive identical, validated data

The one exception is **policy loading for warm-start** (§7), where all ranks load in parallel to avoid bottlenecking on large policy files.

> **Placeholder** — The input loading pipeline diagram (`../../diagrams/exports/svg/data/input-loading-pipeline.svg`) will be revised after the text review is complete.

## 2. File Loading Sequence

Files are loaded in dependency order so that each file can be validated against previously loaded data. Loading fails fast on the first error.

**Schema validation first:** Every JSON file undergoes full schema validation before any other checks. This includes required vs. optional fields, data types, value ranges, and structural constraints (e.g., array lengths, enum values). Similarly, every Parquet file is validated for expected columns, column types, and per-column value constraints. The "Validation" column in the tables below lists only the **additional** cross-reference and semantic checks performed after schema validation passes.

> **Note:** The validations listed in this section are illustrative, not exhaustive. Additional validations may be introduced during implementation or as a result of reviewing other specs. See [Validation Architecture](./validation-architecture.md) for the complete multi-layer validation design.

### 2.6 Cross-Reference Validation

After all files are loaded, a final cross-reference validation pass checks:

- `initial_conditions.json` storage array lengths match hydro registry count
- Inflow model coverage is complete for all operating hydros
- FPHA hyperplanes exist for all hydros with FPHA source `"precomputed"` (hydros with source `"computed"` do not require this file — planes are generated during Initialization)
- Generic constraint entity references resolve to loaded entities
- Policy graph stage transitions are valid (no dangling references)

### 2.7 Policy Files (Warm-Start Only)

| Order | File       | Dependencies | Validation                                                |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 34    | `policy/*` | All above    | State dictionary matches current system, cut format valid |

Policy loading uses a different pattern — see §7 Parallel Policy Loading.

## 3. Dependency Graph

Input files form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies. The loading sequence in §2 is a valid topological ordering of this DAG. Files at the same dependency level may be loaded in any order relative to each other.

> **Placeholder** — The dependency graph diagram (`../../diagrams/exports/svg/data/json-schema-dependencies.svg`) will be revised after the text review is complete.

## 4. Conditional Loading

Some files are loaded only when certain conditions are met. Missing optional files are not errors — the loader uses defaults (typically empty collections or identity values).

| Condition                                                 | Effect                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `training.enabled = false` in `config.json`               | Skip scenario noise generation (but still load models if simulation needs them)                |
| `simulation.enabled = false` in `config.json`             | Skip simulation-specific scenario setup                                                        |
| `policy.mode = "warm_start"` in `config.json`             | Load `policy/*` files (§7)                                                                     |
| Policy graph has cycle (`stages.json`)                    | Validate cycle structure per [Infinite Horizon](../math/infinite-horizon.md)                   |
| Hydros with FPHA production model, source `"precomputed"` | Require `fpha_hyperplanes.parquet`                                                             |
| Hydros with FPHA production model, source `"computed"`    | FPHA hyperplanes computed during Initialization phase from geometry and topology data (see §8) |
| `pumping_stations.json` present                           | Load pumping bounds, validate hydro/bus references                                             |
| `energy_contracts.json` present                           | Load contract bounds                                                                           |
| `non_controllable_sources.json` present                   | Load NCS penalty overrides                                                                     |
| `external_scenarios.parquet` present                      | Use external scenarios instead of PAR-generated ones                                           |

> **Note on external scenarios scope**: The presence of `external_scenarios.parquet` does NOT imply simulation-only usage. External scenarios can also be used during training — see [Scenario Generation SS4.2](./scenario-generation.md). Loading and validation apply identically regardless of the target phase.

## 5. Sparse Time-Series Expansion

Time-series Parquet files (bounds, penalty overrides) use **sparse representation**: only rows with non-default values are stored. Stages and entities not present in the file receive default values.

**Expansion behavior:**

1. Load the sparse Parquet file (only rows with explicit values).
2. Build a dense (stage × entity) structure initialized with defaults.
3. Overlay the sparse values onto the dense structure.
4. Validate that all stage IDs and entity IDs in the sparse data are valid (reference loaded registries).

**Default values:** Each file type has its own default. For bounds files, the default is the static bound from the entity registry. For penalty overrides, the default is the global value from `penalties.json`. This is defined per file in the relevant data model spec — see [Input System Entities](../data-model/input-system-entities.md) and [Penalty System](../data-model/penalty-system.md).

## 6. Broadcast Strategy

After rank 0 loads and validates all data, it broadcasts to worker ranks. Data is serialized to contiguous byte buffers for MPI broadcast. The broadcast uses a two-step protocol: first the buffer size, then the buffer contents.

**Broadcast categories:**

| Category          | Data                                                       | Strategy                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Small objects     | Config, stages, penalties, initial conditions              | Single `MPI_Bcast`                               |
| Entity registries | Buses, lines, hydros, thermals, NCS, pumping, contracts    | Single `MPI_Bcast`                               |
| Scenario models   | PAR parameters, correlation matrices, load models          | Single `MPI_Bcast`                               |
| Bounds/overrides  | All constraint bounds, penalty overrides, exchange factors | Single `MPI_Bcast` (sparse form, expand locally) |
| Policy cuts       | FCF cuts for warm-start                                    | Parallel load (§7)                               |

**Sparse broadcast optimization:** Bounds and penalty override files are broadcast in their sparse Parquet form. Each rank performs the sparse-to-dense expansion locally (§5). This reduces broadcast volume — only non-default values are transmitted.

## 7. Parallel Policy Loading (Warm-Start)

Policy files (cuts, states, vertices, basis) can be large. Loading them on rank 0 and broadcasting would create a bottleneck. Instead, all ranks load in parallel:

1. Rank 0 loads and broadcasts the `policy/metadata.json` and `policy/state_dictionary.json` (small files).
2. All ranks validate the state dictionary against the current system (entity count, state variable mapping).
3. Each rank loads a subset of policy stage files from `policy/cuts/` — stages are assigned round-robin by rank.
4. After local loading, ranks exchange cuts so that every rank has the complete policy. The exchange strategy (e.g., `MPI_Allgatherv` or shared memory window + inter-node broadcast) is an implementation choice.

For the policy file format (FlatBuffers `.bin` files), see [Binary Formats](../data-model/binary-formats.md) SS3.2.

## 8. Transition to In-Memory Model

After loading and broadcasting, each rank constructs its in-memory data model from the loaded data. The in-memory structures are defined in [Internal Structures](../data-model/internal-structures.md) and are not specified here.

**FPHA preprocessing:** For hydros with FPHA production model and source `"computed"`, the FPHA hyperplanes are fitted during the Initialization phase (after validation, before training). Fitting uses the hydro geometry (volume-area-level curves from `hydro_geometry.parquet`), topology data (productivity, tailrace, hydraulic losses, turbine efficiency from `hydros.json`), and fitting configuration (discretization points from `hydro_production_models.json`). See [Hydro Production Models](../math/hydro-production-models.md) for the mathematical formulation and [Input Hydro Extensions](../data-model/input-hydro-extensions.md) for the required input data.

The key invariant is: **after the Initialization phase completes, all ranks hold identical copies of the validated case data** (except for per-rank scenario assignments, which are determined during Scenario Generation). See [CLI and Lifecycle](./cli-and-lifecycle.md) SS5.2 for the phase sequence.
