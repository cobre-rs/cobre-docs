# Validation Architecture

## Purpose

This spec defines the Cobre multi-layer input validation pipeline: the five validation layers, the error collection strategy, the error type catalog, and the validation report format. Validation runs during the Validation phase of the execution lifecycle (see [CLI and Lifecycle](./cli-and-lifecycle.md) SS5.2).

For the file loading sequence and per-file validation checks, see [Input Loading Pipeline](./input-loading-pipeline.md) SS2. This spec defines the _architectural framework_ for validation; the loading pipeline spec defines _what is validated per file_.

## 1. Validation Pipeline Overview

Validation runs on **rank 0 only** during the Validation phase. It collects all errors before failing, so the user sees every problem in a single report rather than fixing issues one at a time.

The pipeline comprises five sequential layers. Each layer depends on the previous one — e.g., referential integrity checks require that schema validation has already confirmed field presence, and semantic checks require that all cross-references have been resolved.

```
Layer 1          Layer 2         Layer 3            Layer 4           Layer 5
Structural    →  Schema       →  Referential     →  Dimensional    →  Semantic
(files, format)  (fields, types)  (foreign keys)    (coverage)        (business rules)
```

**Canonicalization** (sorting all entity collections by ID) occurs during loading, before any validation layer executes. This ensures bit-for-bit reproducibility regardless of declaration order in input files (see [Design Principles](../overview/design-principles.md) SS3).

## 2. Validation Layers

### 2.1 Layer 1 — Structural Validation

Verifies that required files exist and are parseable:

- Required files exist on disk and are readable
- JSON files parse as valid JSON (UTF-8 encoding)
- Parquet files have valid Parquet headers and are readable
- Optional files that are absent are recorded and their defaults noted

Missing required files produce immediate errors. Missing optional files are not errors — the loader uses defaults (see [Input Loading Pipeline](./input-loading-pipeline.md) SS4).

### 2.2 Layer 2 — Schema Validation

Validates that every file conforms to its expected structure:

- **JSON files:** Required vs. optional fields present, data types correct (string, number, boolean, array, object), value ranges valid (e.g., all IDs non-negative, probabilities in [0,1]), enum values valid (e.g., `block_mode` is `"parallel"` or `"chronological"`)
- **Parquet files:** Expected columns present with correct Arrow types, per-column value constraints (e.g., non-negative costs, valid entity IDs)

Schema validation is exhaustive for each file — every field and column is checked. See [Input Loading Pipeline](./input-loading-pipeline.md) SS2 for the per-file validation notes.

### 2.3 Layer 3 — Referential Integrity

Validates cross-entity references (foreign keys):

- Bus IDs referenced by lines, hydros, thermals, NCS, pumping stations, and contracts exist in `buses.json`
- Downstream hydro IDs in cascade topology exist in `hydros.json`
- Stage IDs in time-series Parquet files exist in `stages.json`
- Season IDs in stage definitions match `season_definitions`
- Entity IDs in constraint bounds and penalty override files exist in their respective registries
- Policy graph transition source/target stage IDs exist
- Generic constraint entity references resolve to loaded entities

### 2.4 Layer 4 — Dimensional Consistency

Cross-file dimensional checks ensuring data completeness:

- Inflow model parameters (seasonal stats + AR coefficients) cover all hydros with PAR-based scenario generation
- Inflow history covers all hydros when `inflow_history.parquet` is provided
- Load seasonal stats cover all buses with load when `load_seasonal_stats.parquet` is provided
- Correlation matrix dimensions match the number of hydros in each correlation group
- `initial_conditions.json` storage array length matches hydro registry count
- FPHA hyperplanes exist for all hydros with FPHA source `"precomputed"` (hydros with source `"computed"` do not require this file — planes are generated during Initialization)

### 2.5 Layer 5 — Semantic Validation (Business Rules)

Domain-specific rules that require understanding of the model semantics. Rules are organized by domain. Unless otherwise noted, all rules produce **errors** that prevent execution.

| **ID uniqueness** | Entity IDs unique within each registry (hydros, thermals, buses, lines, etc.) — combined with canonicalization during loading, this guarantees bit-for-bit identical results regardless of declaration order. See [Design Principles](../overview/design-principles.md) SS3 |

#### General Warnings

| Rule              | Description                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unused entity** | **Warning.** Entity defined but appears inactive (e.g., thermal with `max_generation = 0` for all stages) |

#### 2.5b Conditional Validation (mode-dependent)

Certain rules apply only when specific configuration modes or optional files are present:

##### Cyclic Policy Graph (`type = "cyclic"`)

- At least one back-edge transition exists
- Cycle transitions have `annual_discount_rate > 0`
- Cumulative discount factor around any cycle < 1.0 for convergence

##### Warm-Start (`policy.mode = "warm_start"`)

For the four structural compatibility checks (hydro count, max PAR order per hydro, production method per hydro, PAR model parameters per hydro), see [Input Loading Pipeline SS7.1](./input-loading-pipeline.md). All four checks produce `LoadError::PolicyIncompatible`.

Additional policy-graph checks:

- Cut stage IDs exist in current policy graph
- Entity IDs in state dictionary exist in current registries
- At least one stage has stored cuts
- Block mode and block count/durations per stage match between warm-start policy and current configuration. See [Block Formulations](../math/block-formulations.md) SS4

##### Resume (`policy.mode = "resume"`)

- Version compatibility check
- Configuration hash match
- System hash match
- State dictionary checksum match
- All partitioned output files from prior run exist and are readable

##### External Scenarios (`external_scenarios.parquet` present)

- Entity/stage/scenario coverage is complete for all required entities
- Distinct `scenario_id` count equals `num_scenarios`

> **Note**: These validation rules apply regardless of whether external scenarios are used for simulation or training. External scenarios are NOT restricted to simulation — see [Scenario Generation SS3](./scenario-generation.md). When used in training, additional validation applies: a PAR model must be fittable from the external data for backward pass opening tree generation.

##### Linearized Head Model

- Hydros using `linearized_head` production model are accepted only for simulation runs — rejected during training. See [Hydro Production Models](../math/hydro-production-models.md) SS5

> **Note:** Markovian horizon validation (Markov states, transition probabilities per Markov state) is deferred. See [Deferred Features](../deferred.md) SSC.5.

## 3. Error Collection Strategy

Validation collects **all errors** before failing, rather than stopping on the first error. This allows users to fix every problem in a single iteration.

The validation context tracks:

- **Errors** — Validation failures that prevent execution. Each error records the source file, entity (if applicable), error kind, and a human-readable message.
- **Warnings** — Non-fatal observations (e.g., an entity with `max_generation = 0` for all stages, suggesting it may be unused).

Within each layer, all checks run to completion. If a layer produces errors, subsequent layers may still execute for independent checks (e.g., referential integrity errors in one entity registry do not block schema validation of unrelated files). However, certain dependencies are hard — if schema validation fails for a file, no referential integrity checks are attempted for that file's references.

After all layers complete, the validation context is evaluated:

- If **any errors** exist, the program emits a validation report and exits with code 3 (see [CLI and Lifecycle](./cli-and-lifecycle.md) SS4).
- If **only warnings** exist, the program emits the report to the log and continues execution.

Each error carries: **file path**, **entity identifier** (if applicable), **error kind** (from table above), and **message** (human-readable description).

## 5. Validation Report Format

When validation completes (pass or fail), Cobre emits a structured JSON report:

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-31T10:30:00Z",
  "case_directory": "/path/to/case",
  "errors": [
    {
      "file": "system/hydros.json",
      "entity": "hydro_042",
      "kind": "InvalidReference",
      "message": "bus_id 'BUS_99' not found in buses.json"
    },
    {
      "file": "scenarios/inflow_seasonal_stats.parquet",
      "entity": null,
      "kind": "DimensionMismatch",
      "message": "No seasonal stats for hydro 'hydro_015' at stage 48"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "file": "system/thermals.json",
      "entity": "thermal_old",
      "kind": "UnusedEntity",
      "message": "Thermal 'thermal_old' has max_generation=0 for all stages"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "files_checked": 24,
    "entities_validated": 456,
    "error_count": 2,
    "warning_count": 1
  }
}
```

The report is written to `{case_directory}/validation_report.json` and also emitted to the program log. In `--validate-only` mode, the report is the primary output.

### 5.1 Structured Output Integration

When `--output-format json` is specified, the validation report is emitted to stdout wrapped in the CLI response envelope. The `data` field is `null` for validation (the report content is conveyed via `errors` and `warnings`), and the top-level `success` field maps from the existing `valid` field:

```json
{
  "$schema": "urn:cobre:response:v1",
  "command": "validate",
  "success": false,
  "exit_code": 3,
  "cobre_version": "2.0.0",
  "errors": [ ... ],
  "warnings": [ ... ],
  "data": null,
  "summary": { "files_checked": 24, "entities_validated": 456, "error_count": 2, "warning_count": 1 }
}
```

The error records within `errors[]` and `warnings[]` use the enriched error schema defined in [Structured Output SS2](../interfaces/structured-output.md), which extends the existing validation error format with `context` and `suggestion` fields. The existing 14 error kinds from SS4 above are preserved unchanged; they serve as the foundation for the complete error kind registry.

The validation report file (`validation_report.json`) continues to be written to disk regardless of the output format flag. The structured stdout emission is an additional output path, not a replacement.

### 5.2 Response Envelope Reference

The response envelope used by the `validate` subcommand is the same envelope used by all other subcommands. See [Structured Output SS2](../interfaces/structured-output.md) for the complete JSON Schema definition and [CLI and Lifecycle SS8](./cli-and-lifecycle.md) for the output format negotiation.
