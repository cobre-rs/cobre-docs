However, the spec's use of the Philpott et al. (2013) citation for the overall risk-averse SDDP framework is slightly over-attributed -- the paper focuses specifically on _coherent_ risk measures and the _nested_ formulation, not all aspects of the spec (e.g., the EAVaR dual representation in section 4.2 and the sorting algorithm in section 7 are implementation details not derived directly from this paper). The citation is thematically correct but the spec implicitly attributes more to Philpott et al. (2013) than the paper covers. **Additionally, the DOI is wrong** (points to Bertsimas et al., not Philpott et al.) -- see findings-006. |

(2013) is about solving multistage stochastic programs with coherent risk measures. It does discuss the difficulty of computing upper bounds for risk-averse problems (motivating the need for inner approximation). Including it as a reference for the upper bound spec is reasonable for the motivation (section 1, point 1: "CVaR objectives cannot be reliably estimated via Monte Carlo simulation"). However, the paper does not propose the SIDP/Lipschitz inner approximation technique described in the spec.

| #   | Entry                         | Annotation Claim                                                                                                                | Correct?   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Additionally, the following references in specs are to documentation/software rather than academic papers, and are not listed in the bibliography (which is acceptable since the bibliography focuses on academic references):

### Contextual Issues (Detailed Discussion)

#### Issue 1: cut-management.md section 8 -- Guigues & Bandarra convergence claim (CORRECT)

**Claim**: "Under Level-1 or LML1 cut selection, SDDP with finitely many scenarios converges to the optimal value function with probability 1."

**Verification**: Guigues & Bandarra (2019, arXiv:1902.06757; published 2021 in _Computational Management Science_) prove:

- Theorem 3.1: Convergence of single-cut SDDP with Level-1 cut selection
- Theorem 4.1: Convergence of multi-cut SDDP with Level-1 cut selection
- Section 5: Extension to LML1 (Limited Memory Level-1)
- The convergence is finite (with probability 1) under the assumption of finitely many realizations per stage

The claim in the spec accurately summarizes the paper's result. The "finitely many scenarios" qualification is correct and important -- the result does not apply to continuous distributions.

**Verdict**: CORRECT. This is the most important citation to verify per the ticket instructions, and it checks out.

#### Issue 2: Costa et al. (2025) -- Wrong paper at DOI

**Claim in infinite-horizon.md**: The spec attributes the cyclic policy graph and infinite periodic horizon formulation to "Costa, B.S., de Matos, V.L., Philpott, A.B. (2025). SDDP.jl approaches for infinite horizon problems."

**Problem**: The DOI resolves to a completely different paper by different authors with a different title. This makes the citation contextually unverifiable. The formulation in the spec (cyclic policy graphs, seasonal cut sharing, fixed-point interpretation) is mathematically sound and consistent with known SDDP.jl infinite horizon approaches, but the attribution cannot be confirmed.

**Impact**: HIGH. The spec's primary reference for its core formulation is broken.

#### Issue 3: Costa & Leclere (2023) -- Wrong title at URL

**Claim in upper-bound-evaluation.md**: The spec attributes the Lipschitz-based vertex inner approximation (SIDP) to "Costa, B.S., & Leclere, V. (2023). Lipschitz-based Inner Approximation of Risk Measures."

**Problem**: The URL points to "Duality of upper bounds in stochastic dynamic programming." The spec describes a specific technique (Lipschitz interpolation, vertex-based inner approximation) and attributes it to this paper, but the actual paper at the URL has a different focus. The technique described in the spec may come from a different paper by the same authors (possibly arXiv:2107.10930 or the 2024 journal version).

**Impact**: HIGH. The spec's primary reference for its core technique has wrong metadata.

#### Issue 4: Larroyd et al. (2022) -- Wrong title and authors for DOI

**Claim in inflow-nonnegativity.md**: References the paper for inflow non-negativity methods.

**Problem**: The DOI resolves to a paper about negative inflows by different authors. The topic matches but the metadata does not. The spec's claim about inflow non-negativity treatment is likely correct for the actual paper at the DOI, but the citation gives the wrong title and wrong co-authors.

**Impact**: MEDIUM. The contextual claim is probably correct, but the metadata mismatch creates confusion.

#### Issue 5: Philpott et al. (2013) -- Wrong DOI propagated to specs

**Problem**: The bibliography has DOI `10.1287/opre.2013.1200` which resolves to Bertsimas et al. (a completely different paper). This wrong DOI is propagated to `risk-measures.md` (line 270) and `upper-bound-evaluation.md` (line 209). Any reader clicking the DOI link will reach the wrong paper.

**Impact**: HIGH. Two spec files contain a clickable DOI link to the wrong paper.

#### Issue 6: de Matos et al. (2015) -- Orphan despite being foundational

**Problem**: The bibliography claims this paper is "Basis for the cut selection in `cobre-sddp`", yet it is never cited in any spec or algorithm file. The cut management spec and cut selection algorithm page cite only Guigues & Bandarra (2019) for convergence, with no mention of de Matos et al. (2015) as the source of the Level-1 strategy itself.

**Impact**: LOW. Not a correctness issue, but a completeness gap. The Level-1 cut selection strategy was proposed in de Matos et al. (2015) and should be cited in `cut-management.md` section 7.1.

#### Issue 7: Shapiro (2011) annotation is reductive

**Problem**: The bibliography annotation says "Risk-averse SDDP with CVaR" but the paper covers convergence analysis, complexity, and multiple aspects of SDDP beyond just risk-averse CVaR. The annotation gives a misleadingly narrow characterization.

**Impact**: LOW. The annotation is not wrong, just incomplete.

### Recommendations

#### Priority 1 (Must fix -- contextual correctness)

1. **Fix Costa et al. (2025) citation** or identify the correct paper for the infinite horizon formulation. The spec's mathematical content is sound; the reference just needs to point to the actual source.

2. **Fix Philpott et al. (2013) DOI** from `10.1287/opre.2013.1200` to `10.1287/opre.2013.1175` in bibliography.md, risk-measures.md (line 270), and upper-bound-evaluation.md (line 209).

3. **Fix Costa & Leclere (2023) citation** -- correct the title to match the actual paper at the URL, or find the correct URL for the paper describing SIDP/Lipschitz inner approximation.

4. **Fix Larroyd et al. (2022) citation** -- correct the title and author list to match the DOI target.

#### Priority 2 (Should fix -- completeness)

5. **Add de Matos et al. (2015) citation** to `cut-management.md` section 7.1 as the original source of the Level-1 cut selection strategy.

6. **Add annotation** to Philpott & de Matos (2012) bibliography entry -- it is the only entry without a description.

7. **Expand Shapiro (2011) annotation** to mention convergence analysis alongside CVaR.

#### Priority 3 (Nice to have)

8. **Consider adding Benders (1962) and Birge (1985)** to bibliography.md since they are cited in spec/algorithm files.

9. **Consider adding citation** to Philpott & Guan (2008) from `stopping-rules.md` or `sddp-algorithm.md` for convergence theory, to avoid it being orphaned.
